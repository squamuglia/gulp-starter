# 🧜‍♂️ Static Site Starter

This starter uses 🥤Gulp 4 and is designed for static HTML sites. Build your pages in HTML, link between them with `<a>` tags, just like the Internet intended.

Includes typescript support with source mapping, image optimization, PostCSS and some atomic css classes.

Comes with few opinions that are easy to delete, and a Gulpfile with comments that make it easy to modify.

### Getting started

```
yarn install && yarn start
```

Modify index.html and see what happens. I dare you. Add as many .html pages as you like.
